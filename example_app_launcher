## Example Application
# your app's special walkaround

prefix='example'							# give a unique name to your wineprefix
build='4.0'									# this is the dir name in cellar, provided by winehq or your own build.
install='/opt/wine-stable'					# '/opt/wine-stable', '/opt/wine-devel' or '/opt/wine-staging', used for store official winehq (on fedora or maybe your distro) to $cellar(default location is "$HOME/swh/cellar"). For your own built wine, copy it into $cellar
build_arch=win64							# win32 or win64. arch of your installed/built wine pagkage. when set to win64, you can create 32bit prefix by set WINEARCH=win32
WINEARCH=win64								# win32 or win64. arch of your wineprefix

#invoker=""											# primusrun; perf recored
runner=wine											# wine, wine64, winedbg
#export WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winemenubuilder.exe=d 		# disable winemenubuilder so wine will not create shortcuts to your native linux system, but don't disable it if you are using production software!
#LC_ALL=zh_CN.utf8									# for non-unicode program, see 'locale -a' command
